Writing scripts to automate my regular orders using the red robin website

Currently, just paste the script in `src/index.js` into the javascript developer console in Chrome. It needs to be run once you are on the order site on `https://order.redrobin.com/menu/red-robin-alderwood` or whatever location you're at. It only works when it has a mobile layout (reduce your window's width to make the site responsively go from desktop to mobile mode).

I couldn't get it to run from my iPhone yet, so... whatever.
